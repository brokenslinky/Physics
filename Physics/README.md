# ToDo
Add summaries to classes and methods
Add implicit conversion of Vector and Scalar to double?
Add Determinant() and Direction() methods to Tensor
Add collection of Objects with Iterate() method to update all Objects in the collection simultaneously
	- take advantage of Runge-Kutta and multithreading
Define vector division (return a tensor)?
